## Dataverse CURATION Quick Reference Guide

- **Level 1:** The minimum steps required to successfully publish in Dataverse and make the dataset findable, i.e., the dataset has been submitted to the proper dataverse and required metadata fields are accurate.
- **Level 2:** Activities that enhance the discoverability of datasets and help ensure their usability over time. E.g., recommended metadata fields are populated and dataset includes sufficient documentation to allow a user with a similar background to understand the dataset and open and use the files.
- **Level 3:** Intensive curation actions intended to prepare datasets for preservation and improve the chances that data and code can be used to reproduce or replicate an associated study. For example, supporting documentation is enhanced, the content of files and code are reviewed, and data files are transformed into formats suitable for long-term preservation.
